            <i><span>Apr 28, 2020 </span> <img src="img/circle.svg" width="6px" alt=""> <span><a href="#"> React</a></span></i>
            <p>A couple weeks ago I started working on my first React application. Not only was it my first React application, but it was also my first React Native application, so a lot was new to me all in one go. Coming from the Angular (and Ionic) world, it felt like... </p>

            <p>I've recently been going down a rabbit hole of making improvements to my CanIUse embed. To give a bit of a background, it is an interactive embed I created to easily embed data from caniuse.com in my blog posts and anywhere else. I previously wrote about how I first... </p>
